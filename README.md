# EmoRecog-Net
EmoRecog-Net is a multimodal deep learning framework for video-induced emotion categorization and intensity recognition from fMRI and physiological signals (PPG and respiration).

The model integrates:

CNN-based spatial feature extraction

GRU-based temporal modeling

MLP-driven nonlinear multimodal fusion

Evaluated on the ICBHI 2024 multimodal benchmark, EmoRecog-Net achieved the lowest official Finalscore (0.2815) among competing approaches, outperforming CNN-LSTM, graph-based, and autoencoder baselines.
